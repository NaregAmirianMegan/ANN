# Artificial Neural Network
Java implementation of a neural network that uses momentum influenced gradient descent. 
Includes implementation of an error graph to test for efficiency of training.

Use TestNeuralNet.java as base framework for training data.


# TO DO
Implement a dropout rate to counteract potential overfitting by the use of momentum in the current model. 
Implement multilayer functionality to improve models computational ability.
